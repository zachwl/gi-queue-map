# gi-queue-map
This project seeks to collect, clean, aggregate, and map generator interconnection (GI) queue data across the whole of the United States. By collecting data from all types of balancing authorities (independent systems operators, utilities, and electric cooperatives) this dataset will be able to provide a broader understanding about the state of grid interconnections.
